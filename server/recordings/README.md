# Pre-recorded animation videos

Place MP4 files here to use them instead of generated animations. No moviepy/setuptools required.

**Naming:** Use snake_case, e.g.:
- `brush_teeth.mp4` – matches prompts like "Brush your teeth", "Brush teeth"
- `wake_up.mp4` – matches "Wake up", "Morning"
- `wash_hands.mp4` – matches "Wash hands", "Wash face"
- `get_dressed.mp4` – matches "Get dressed", "Put on clothes"
- `reading_book.mp4` – matches "Read a book", "Story"
- `eating_breakfast.mp4` – matches "Eat breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner"

You can also add entries in `recordings_resolver.py` in `PROMPT_TO_VIDEO` to map keywords to your filenames.
